<pre>
She has eyes,

Which smile
Once in a while
To reconcile
With hopes that beguile
And cruelly defile
That elusive smile.

Her tears, but the Nile
Her wrinkles run a mile
Her heart, a lonely isle.

But fighting the trial
Of Hope's dark guile
She stops a while
And does still smile.

Even if once a while
An elusive smile.
