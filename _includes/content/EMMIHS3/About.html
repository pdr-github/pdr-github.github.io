  It is no longer just science-fiction. Humans are really working on concrete projects today in 2020, not only on the
  exploration but also colonization of space! We are thinking already of building a functional Moon Village by 2050. The
  Moon Village is an open concept proposed with the goal of a sustainable human and robotic presence on the lunar
  surface as an ensemble where multiple users can carry out multiple activities.

  Since it is very difficult for humans to live in space for long periods (as it is, it's already complicated here on
  Planet Earth), a lot of research needs to be on surviving out there and hence space agencies are coming together and
  collaborating on various analogue missions that simulate space environments - such as lunar/martian villages.
