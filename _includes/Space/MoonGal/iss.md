<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>
  The Moon Gallery consiting of 64 artworks in total on an 8x8 grid is installed inside a Nanoracks Nanolab, serving as moving targets for camera observations and performance tests. The gallery offers a diverse range of materials and behaviours for the camera to detect, and in return, the artists would get a chance to learn about the performance of their artworks in microgravity.
