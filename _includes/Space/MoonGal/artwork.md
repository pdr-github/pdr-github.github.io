  The concept of Duality has intrigued mankind since the beginning of civilization, and ancient Vedic texts propose several philosophies on the duality of nature in intriguing detail.

  The artwork comprises of two objects constrained inside a 1cm³ box: a strip of paper with handdrawn phases of the Moon in glow-in-the-dark ink, and a nano-sim card that contains artistic simulations that are coded using Python programming language. Inspired by her Indian roots and Vedic influence, work is named “Bhedadipika – an illustration of Duality”. It plays upon several notions of Duality such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Constraint/Freedom</li>
    <li>Light/Darkness</li>
    <li>Minute/Infinite</li>
    <li>Reality/Illusion</li>
    <li>Randomness/Intent</li>
  </ul>
  The animated images are part of a series of algorithmic art titled “Star Cities/Organised Worlds”. These images are created by randomly generated points, but which are constrained to appear on a path defined by equations of <b>epitrochoids and hypotrochoids</b> of various parameters. An epitrochoid or hypotrochoid basically describes the path traced by a spirograph, and is one of the fundamental curves depicting movement in Nature: from celestial orbits to rolling objects. They instill a sense of harmony in the spectator, as the form is naturally pleasing to the eye. The artist imagines that if intelligent life were able to manipulate the formation of galaxies, it would exploit the humble hypotrochoid for inspiration for harmonious forms.
