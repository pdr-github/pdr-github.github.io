<h2>About the "Our Giant Leap" initiative</h2>
<p>
	Who doesn’t dream about Space? It is the next frontier of human exploration. However, the Space sector still has a long way to go in becoming inclusive for everyone, especially women. The question becomes not simply, how to inspire, but how to sustain these dreams?
	<br><br>
	The “Our Giant Leap” (OGL) initiative was born with the aim to build a Space network that would collaborate to push boundaries and achieve this objective of making the aerospace environment diversity-friendly.
	<br><br>
	Priyanka was one of the founding members of this initiative and was instrumental in its structuring, reach and shaping future goals.
<br><br>
This initiative received the SGAC "Member of the month" award in <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/mom-october-2020">October 2020</a>.

	With the help of a very dedicated team, the OGL team kickstarted this initiative with the SGAC. The kickoff event was launched on 26th October, 2020, as <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/event/sgfrance-2020">SG[France] 2020</a> at ISAE-Supaéro, Toulouse (France). It was the only face-to-face event of the SGAC in 2020.
