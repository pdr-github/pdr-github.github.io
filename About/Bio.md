		<h2>Exploring the Art+Science Duality in the context of Space</h2>
		<br>
		Dr. Priyanka Das Rajkakati is a French Aerospace engineer-cum-artist, born in India, whose work involves mixing science, art and space. From being an artist of the <a href="/Portfolio/MoonGallery"> Moon Gallery</a>, co-founding <a href="Research/TEC/home"> The Exploration Company</a>, to participating in a <a href="/Research/EMMIHS3/home"> lunar analog astronaut simulation</a>, she has a particular fascination with lunar exploration.
		<br><br>
		Growing up in Delhi, obtaining a bachelor in Physics from St. Stephen's College, she moved to France at age 21 to explore new horizons, learn a new language and eat French food. While studying engineering at Ecole-Polytechnique and ISAE-Supa√©ro, and then obtaining a Ph.D. in satellite navigation, she found equal if not more satisfaction from her art projects and #S.T.E.A.M. outreach.
		<br><br>
		Her work draws inspiration from her Indian roots and her travels, from Brazil to Mauna Loa volcano in Hawai'i and next: Antarctica. As an artist-scientist in the space industry, she has won numerous awards, including a feature in the Forbes India 30 under 30 list, and the 2021 Karman Fellowship.
