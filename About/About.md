title: About me
---

<p align="justify">
	Since I was child, I have had three passions: Space, Science and Art.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	 With the quest to mix the three, I experimented extensively with my interests. A few unconventional choices later, I went from being a Physicist to an Aerospace Engineer and now finally, a Space Artist (and also analogue-astronaut).
</p>
<p align="justify">
	For me, art and science are not distinct. When you pursue both fields, you reach a “grey zone” where the art you do requires a bit of science, and the science you do is arguably artistic.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	After years spent pursuing scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating to the artistic aspect of the subject at hand:
</p>

<p align="center">
	In Biology, I was enthralled by bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns.

<p align="center">
	In Computer Science, I saw an infinite potential for algorithmic art, even those generated by AI.

</p>

<p align="center">
	In Signal Processing, I was fascinated by the geometric patterns made by signals and noise, Fourier Transforms and Gaussian curves.

	This is the grey zone that excites me, and where I have currently set up my workshop, drawing inspiration from the work of scientists, even philosophers.

	I invite you to come along on my journey through my website :).

  About the artist

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
