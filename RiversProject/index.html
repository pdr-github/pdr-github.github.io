        The "Rivers from our Veins" project aims at using a cross-disciplinary approach involving <b>space technologies</b> and <b>design thinking for social innovation</b>, to help the state of Assam be better prepared for floods, improving monitoring and decision-making, as well as further educating local communities.

        The main objective of this project would be to develop a community-based flood early warning and risk management system in Assam. The secondary goal would be to bring together a network of changemakers motivated to solve critical problems in the region of Assam. Last but not least, this would be an opportunity to demonstrate the impact of artistic and design-thinking approaches in the reduction of the gap between scientific models and social reality.
