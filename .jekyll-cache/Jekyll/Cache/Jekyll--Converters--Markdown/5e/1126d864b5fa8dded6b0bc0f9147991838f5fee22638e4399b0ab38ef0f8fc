	The International Space Education Board (ISEB) program is a wonderful opportunity for students to have privileged access to events during the International Astronautical Congress (IAC), including interactive sessions with astronauts and top space personnels, such as heads of space agencies. In 2019, Priyanka was one of 10 European students who were awarded the ESA ISEB sponsorship for attending the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2019, in Washington DC. She presented a paper on Lunar GNSS during the conference.
