	Who doesn‚Äôt dream about Space? It is the next frontier of human exploration. However, the Space sector still has a long way to go in becoming inclusive for everyone, especially women. The question becomes not simply, how to inspire, but how to sustain these dreams?
	<br /><br />
	The ‚ÄúOur Giant Leap‚Äù (OGL) initiative was born with the aim to build a Space network that would collaborate to push boundaries and achieve this objective of making the aerospace environment diversity-friendly.

	With the help of a very dedicated team, the OGL team kickstarted this initiative with the <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/">Space Generation Advisory Council</a> (SGAC). The kickoff event was launched on 26th October, 2020, as <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/event/sgfrance-2020">SG[France] 2020</a> at ISAE-Supa√©ro, Toulouse (France).
