I"ß<pre>
	We've had rough times, you and I
	Yet underneath this endless sky
	I have come to know

	Time's infinitude lets each wound heal
	It changes all we love, and all we feel
	And lets us all grow

	Grow old, move on, evolve, adapt
	No ties stay strong, No bonds, strapped
	As transient as snow

	So, if our sunshine days have set
	Know that I will never forget
	A single moment, since when we first met
	And we'll laugh again, with no regret

	For we'd have loved more.
