	In 2019, Priyanka was one of 10 European students who were Awarded the ESA ISEB sponsorship for attending the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2019, in Washington DC. She presented a paper on Lunar GNSS during the conference.

	The International Space Education Board (ISEB) program is a wonderful opportunity for students to have privileged interactive sessions with astronauts and top space personnels, such as heads of space agencies. I came back with new collaborations in both scientific and artistic fields, presented my ideas to the exciting Space community, and even gained an astronaut mentor!
