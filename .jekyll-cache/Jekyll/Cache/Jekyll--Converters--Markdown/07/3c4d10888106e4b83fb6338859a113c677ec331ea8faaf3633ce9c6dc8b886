<pre>
We've had rough times, you and I
Yet beneath this endless sky
I have come to know

Time's expanse lets each wound heal
Changes all we love, and feel
And lets us all grow

Grow, move on, evolve, adapt
No ties stay strong, No bonds, strapped
As transient as snow

If our sunshine days have set
Know that I'll never forget
A moment since when we first met
For we'll laugh again, and with no regret

For we'd have loved more.
