<p align="justify" style="font-size:18px">
	Who doesn‚Äôt dream about Space? It is the next frontier of human exploration. However, the Space sector still has a long way to go in becoming inclusive for everyone, especially women. The question becomes not simply, how to inspire, but how to sustain these dreams?
	<br /><br />
	The ‚ÄúOur Giant Leap‚Äù initiative was born with the aim to build a Space network that would collaborate to push boundaries and achieve this objective of making the aerospace environment diversity-friendly.

	With the help of a very dedicated team, we kickstarted this initiative with the <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/">Space Generation Advisory Council</a> (SGAC). We will be launching our event as <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/event/sgfrance-2020">SG[France] 2020</a> in June (venue: ISAE-Supa√©ro, Toulouse).

	I am part of the Programs (lead for the Mentorship Working Group) and Communication teams. Through the latter, I designed the logo and poster for the initiative and presented it during the IAC 2019 in Washington DC. I also worked on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pErzslMIl68&amp;feature=emb_logo">video</a> for our event:
