      It is no longer just science-fiction. Humans are really working on concrete projects today in 2020, not only on the exploration but also colonization of space! We are thinking already of building a functional Moon Village by 2050. The Moon Village is an open concept proposed with the goal of a sustainable human and robotic presence on the lunar surface as an ensemble where multiple users can carry out multiple activities.
      <br /><br />
      Since it is very difficult for humans to live in space for long periods (as it is, it's already complicated here on Planet Earth), a lot of research needs to be on surviving out there and hence space agencies are coming together and collaborating on various analogue missions that simulate space environments - such as lunar/martian villages.

      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Lunar_Exploration_Working_Group">International Lunar Exploration Working Group</a> (ILEWG) is a public forum sponsored by the world's space agencies (like NASA and ESA) to support international cooperation towards the exploration and utilization of the Moon. As part of research efforts towards the colonization of Moon and creation of a Moon Village (and eventually Mars), ILEWG founded the EuroMoonMars initiative. It comprises of field campaigns in Moon-Mars analogue environments ‚Äì basically regions on Earth that resemble other planets/space bodies.
      <br /><br />
      One such analogue environment is the <a href="https://hi-seas.org/">Hawaii-Space Exploration Analog and Simulation</a> (HI-SEAS). It is located at 2,500 meters in elevation on the slopes of Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii, and resembles the surface of the Moon with its lava caves and lava tubes. It is a great training ground for astronaut-simulation missions. Additional fact: HI-SEAS is owned by the founder of the <a href="https://moonbasealliance.com/">International Moonbase Alliance</a> (IMA), Henk Rogers, who is also world-famous for his work in video games (another person who has mixed Space and Art!) EuroMoonMars, IMA and HI-SEAS (<a href="https://emmihs-esa.webnode.nl/">EMMIHS</a>) are collaborating on the EMMIHS campaigns that consist of scientific research, field tests, training and outreach activities.

      Through the European Space Agency EuroMoonMars program, Priyanka was one of the six analogue-astronauts for the third mission, EMMIHS-III, a two-week mission in January 2020. She trained under the director of HI-SEAS, Michaela Musilova, as crew-commander. She also conducted research on several topics including navigation, lava-cave exploration, robotics, crew-psychology, geology, culture and art. She also designed the team logo.

	Who doesn‚Äôt dream about Space? It is the next frontier of human exploration. However, the Space sector still has a long way to go in becoming inclusive for everyone, especially women. The question becomes not simply, how to inspire, but how to sustain these dreams?
	<br /><br />
	The ‚ÄúOur Giant Leap‚Äù (OGL) initiative was born with the aim to build a Space network that would collaborate to push boundaries and achieve this objective of making the aerospace environment diversity-friendly.
	<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
	With the help of a very dedicated team, the OGL team kickstarted this initiative with the <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/">Space Generation Advisory Council</a> (SGAC). The kickoff event was launched on 26th October, 2020, as <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/event/sgfrance-2020">SG[France] 2020</a> at ISAE-Supa√©ro, Toulouse (France).

	Priyanka was one of the original founders of this initiative and took part in its organisation as part of the Programs team (responsible for the Mentorship Working Group) and Communication team. Through the latter, she designed the logo and poster for the initiative and presented it during the Space Generation Congress (SGC) 2019 and the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2019 in Washington DC. She also worked on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pErzslMIl68&amp;feature=emb_logo">video</a> for the event, as well as recording retd. CNES astronaut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5f_sSXBi7k">Claudie Haigner√©'s message</a> for the participants. Lastly, she intiated the "Call for Artwork" program with the help of the OGL Communication team, through which OGL received more than 30 original artwork from across the world on the theme "Women in Aerospace", showcased <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T011D7ADA94/C0136NLHYJH">here</a> in the official OGL Slack channel.
