		<h2>Exploring the Art+Science Duality in the context of Space</h2>
		<br />
		Dr. Priyanka Das Rajkakati is a French Aerospace engineer-cum-artist, born in India, whose work involves mixing science, art and space. From the Moon Gallery art project, to co-founding <a href="https://exploration.space/"> The Exploration Company</a>, focusing on the development of a space vehicle, she has a particular fascination with lunar exploration. 
		<br /><br />
		Growing up in Delhi, obtaining a bachelor in Physics from St. Stephen's College, she moved to France at age 21 to explore new horizons, learn a new language and eat French food. While studying engineering at Ecole-Polytechnique and ISAE-Supa√©ro, and then obtaining a Ph.D. in satellite navigation, she found equal if not more satisfaction from her art projects and #S.T.E.A.M. outreach.
		<br /><br />
		Her work draws inspiration from her Indian roots and her travels, from Brazil to Mauna Loa volcano in Hawai'i (during short experience as an Analog Astronaut) and next: Antarctica. As an artist-scientist in the space industry, she has won numerous awards, including a feature in the Forbes India 30 under 30 and the 2021 Karman Fellowship.
