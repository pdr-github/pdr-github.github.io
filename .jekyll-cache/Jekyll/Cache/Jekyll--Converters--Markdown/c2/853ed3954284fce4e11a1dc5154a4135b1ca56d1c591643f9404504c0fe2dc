	One of the highlights of last year, I was very fortunate to have been awarded the ESA ISEB sponsorship for attending the International Astronautical Congress 2019, in Washington DC.
	<br /><br />
	An artist and Aerospace PhD student, I had first attended the IAC in 2018 in Bremen simply as a spectator - yet it was amazingly productive. This year with my own accepted papers at the IAC and the prestigious ESA Sponsorship, I went with the expectation that the IAC 2019 experience would be even richer and grant a closer access to the Space community - and I was not disappointed! We had privileged interactive sessions with several high profile personnel such as Jim Bridenstein, Jan WÃ¶rner and several astronauts. I came back with new collaborations in both scientific and artistic fields, presented my ideas to the exciting Space community, and even gained an astronaut mentor!
