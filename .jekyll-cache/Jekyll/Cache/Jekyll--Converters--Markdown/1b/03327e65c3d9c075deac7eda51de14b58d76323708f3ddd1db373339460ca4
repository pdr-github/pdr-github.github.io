<h2>PriyanKaleidoscope</h2>
<p>
	My life resembles a three-sided Kaleidoscope. Each side represents the things I have been passionate about since I was a child: Science, Art ... and Space. Individually, each is just a regular fa√ßade depicting my interests, but combined they reflect a shining myriad of possibilities which complete me.
</p>
<h3>Space-girl</h3>
<p>
	A hitchhiker through the journey of life, I have always been in search of a route that would ultimately lead me into Space. Born in the Himalayan mountains, I grew up in Delhi, moved to France, and this year ‚Äì a lunar analogue-astronaut mission in Hawai‚Äôi and a voyage to Antarctica!
</p>
<h3>Art in Science in Space</h3>
<p>
	Growing up, I often wondered how to chart out a path that would successfully mix these three domains into a single passion. It took me a few unconventional choices, but finally I've started to see the end of the tunnel. It's as though I have come "full-helix" - having started an art and design degree, to leaving it to become a Physicist, to becoming an Aerospace Engineer, to NASA, ESA, and now finally, somehow, a Space Artist (and also analogue-astronaut).
	<br /><br />
	For me, art and science are not distinct. When you pursue both fields, you inevitably reach a ‚Äúgrey zone‚Äù, where the art you do requires a bit of science, and the science you do is fantastically artistic. It was not very surprising that, after years spent pursuing scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating towards the artistic aspect of the subject at hand. Would you like some examples?
	<br /><br />
	In Biology, I was fascinated by bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns. This picture below is a bacterial culture that I had infused with Green-Fluorescent Protein (GFP) extracted from jellyfish. I was in fact so enthralled by the outcome, that I managed to "borrow" these samples to show to my friends; but the security guards who caught me on CCTV behaved as though I were stealing national treasure.

	In Computer Science, I saw an infinite potential for algorithmic art. Here is a fun fact: I made these simulations when I was first learning to code. I took a different approach than the rest of my classmates - motivated by art-lust - and started programming with a passion. A physics professor thought I was a Computer WhizKid because my graphical interface was so convincingly elaborate.

	In Signal Processing, I was fascinated by the geometric patterns made by signals and noise, Fourier Transforms and Gaussian curves. I am actually pursuing a PhD at the moment in this domain, on satellite navigation. When the engineer I work with at University, showed me this GPS signal code he had written, I could not stop thinking of the art one could create out of it (and science too, obviously).

	And the list goes on...

	This is the grey zone that excites me, and where I have currently set up my workstation, drawing inspiration from the work of scientists, philosophers, and through collaborations with other artists.
