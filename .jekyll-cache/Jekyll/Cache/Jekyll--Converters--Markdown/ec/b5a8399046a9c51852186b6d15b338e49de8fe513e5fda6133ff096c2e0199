	Scientists are not just people in lab coats having no life outside the laboratory ‚Äì most of them are incredibly artistic and understand the importance of cultural activities (like music, dance and painting) for human beings. Therefore, the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) set up the Committee for the Cultural Utilisation of Space (ITACCUS). In 2019 I was elected an expert to the committee.
	<br /><br />
	ArtMoonMars is an initiative by ITACCUS to highlight the importance of artists with respect to space exploration: Artists can convey multiple messages of the community including planetary science, life sciences, astronomy, fundamental research, resources utilisation, human spaceflight, peaceful cooperation, economic development, inspiration, training &amp; capacity building.
<br /><br />
	The <a href="http://www.moongallery.eu/">Moon Gallery</a>, by ArtMoonMars, is an international collaborative artwork and a gallery of ideas worth sending to the Moon. Moon Gallery intends to launch 100 artifacts to the Moon within the compact format of a 10 x 10 x 1 cm plate on a lunar lander exterior panelling as early as 2022. As it costs 1 million euros/kg to send something to the Moon, these smart artists proposed to hence miniaturise the gallery. The idea is to develop culture for a future interplanetary society in this Petri dish-like gallery.
<br /><br />
The main team involves Anna Sitnikova (curator, exhibition designer), Elizaveta Glukhova (curator, graphic designer), Bernard Foing (space sector expert and visionary), and Alexander Zaklynsky (gallery founder). I met some of them at space conferences and one meeting led to another and hence I am, as one of the main artists to the gallery!

<h2><b>My contribution</b></h2>
<p align="justify">
	I <a href="http://www.moongallery.eu/artist/priyanka-das-rajkakati/">developed a concept</a> based on a subject close to my heart: Duality, as an artist and scientist. The concept of duality has intrigued mankind since the beginning of civilization, and we find a lot of literature in ancient Vedic texts about it.
	<br /><br />
	The artwork comprises of two objects constrained inside a 1cm¬≥ box: a strip of paper where I drew the phases of the Moon in glow-in-the-dark ink, and a nano-sim card that contains artistic simulations that I coded using the Python programming language. Inspired by my Indian roots and the Vedic influence, I named my work ‚ÄúBhedadipika ‚Äì an illustration of Duality‚Äù.
