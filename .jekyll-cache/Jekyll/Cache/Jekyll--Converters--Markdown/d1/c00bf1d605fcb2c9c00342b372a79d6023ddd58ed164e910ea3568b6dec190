	Priyanka joined the SGAC <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/sgac-welcomes-newly-recruited-members-february">PR&amp;Comm team</a> in 2020, in order to gain valuable experience in understanding how a huge venture like the SGAC manages its promotional content and communication strategies. She has worked on the design of banners and posters for events, such as the SGAC Greeting card, and she's also helping set up an SGAC Art Gallery.
	<br /><br />
	The PR&amp;Comm team collectively received the SGAC "Member of the month" award in <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/mom-june-2020">June 2020</a>, for facilitating the promotion and outreach of more than 30 webinars worldwide over the course of April through June.
