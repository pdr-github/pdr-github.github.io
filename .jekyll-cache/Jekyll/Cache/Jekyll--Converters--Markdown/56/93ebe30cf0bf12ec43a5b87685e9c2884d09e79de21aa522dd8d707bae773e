	Priyanka has always lived a dual personality, with two, often contradictory and vivid, sides fused into one: as an expressive artist and also as a reserved, logic-oriented scientist. And then, a wide-eyed passion for Space and the Cosmos.

	Through years spent experimenting with various scientific fields, including pursuing a PhD in Aerospace engineering, she realised that she kept repeatedly gravitating towards the artistic aspect of the subject at hand. For example: bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns in Biology; algorithmic art in Computer Science; and, during her PhD research on satellite signals, the fascinating patterns made by signals and accumulated noise. Thus, it was clear, that Science and Art are not orthogonal entities but simply complementary ways of experiencing Nature.

	<b>Art+Science+Space:</b> On discovering that the domain of Space research was in fact highly interdisciplinary field, Priyanka found a context for her work in mixing Art and Science. Her work currently involves experimentation with mixed-media art techniques, visual representation of data. She has also illustrated for magazine covers, articles and design-work. She is also quite actively involved in outreach activities, as ambassador of the Lâ€™Oreal-UNESCO Girls in Science initiative, as member of the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC), as expert to the IAF Technical Committee on the Cultural Utilisation of Space (ITACCUS) and finally, through collaborations with the EuroMoonMars initiative. Through the Homeward Bound initiative for women in science, she will also be taking part in a trip to Antarctica in 2021 and wishes to use this as a platform for more art-science projects.
