	Ever since I can remember I have been interested in three specific things: Space, Science and Art.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	Growing up, I often thought about how grand it would be to live a life that mixed these three into a single passion, and set off on a quest on the ultimate pursuit of happiness. After extensive experimentation and several unconventional choices, I have started to see the end of the tunnel. I have nearly come full-helix, having started with an art and design degree, to becoming a Physicist, to an Aerospace Engineer and now finally, somehow, a Space Artist (and also analogue-astronaut).

	For me, art and science are not distinct. When you pursue both fields, you reach a “grey zone” where the art you do requires a bit of science, and the science you do is arguably artistic.

	After years spent pursuing scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating to the artistic aspect of the subject at hand:

<p align="center">
	In Biology, I was enthralled by bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns.

<p align="center">
	In Computer Science, I saw an infinite potential for algorithmic art.

<p align="center">
	In Signal Processing, I was fascinated by the geometric patterns made by signals and noise, Fourier Transforms and Gaussian curves.

</p>

<p>
	And the list goes on...
</p>

<p class="message" align="justify">
	This is the grey zone that excites me, and where I have currently set up my workshop, drawing inspiration from the work of scientists, philosophers, and on collaborating with other artists.

	I invite you to come along on my journey through my website :).
