I"5<pre>
I feel not tired, nothing aches to sleep.
Yet, my mind says, "I'm not yours alone to keep,
For it's time my darling, that you come with me,
And enter the world I create for you to see.

It's the world of dreams where I leave you at night,
So while you enjoy your wonderment, I can take flight,
And go where I must, maybe someday I'll take,
You to my realm, one of such a different make.

But until that day, my dove, you must
Sleep the nights, and let reality rust..."

So I feel I must now go off to bed,
And watch my mind's show for tonight instead.
