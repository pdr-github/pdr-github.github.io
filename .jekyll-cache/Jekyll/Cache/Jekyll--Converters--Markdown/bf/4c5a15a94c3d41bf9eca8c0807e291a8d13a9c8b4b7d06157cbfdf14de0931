	<h2>Exploring the Art+Science Duality</h2>
	<p>
		Priyanka Das Rajkakati is a Ph.D. in Aerospace engineering, who dedicates her time to exploring the grey region between art and science - with as backdrop, the fascinating domain of space research.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Born in the Himalayan mountains, Priyanka grew up in the hustle and bustle of New Delhi and moved to France at age 21, to discover new cultures, learn new languages and explore diverse domains. Through years spent experimenting with various scientific fields, including pursuing a PhD in Aerospace engineering, she realised that she kept repeatedly gravitating towards the artistic aspect of the subject at hand. For example: bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns in Biology; algorithmic art in Computer Science; and, during her PhD research on satellite navigation, the fascinating patterns made by signals and accumulated noise. Thus, she got a firsthand taste of a well-known fact: that Science and Art are not disjoint entities but simply different viewpoints on experiencing Nature and the Cosmos.

		Quite rattled by the current state of humanity through her own experiences, Priyanka is also actively involved in STEM and art outreach activities: as ambassador of the L’Oreal-UNESCO Girls in Science initiative, as member of the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC), as expert to the IAF Technical Committee on the Cultural Utilisation of Space (ITACCUS) and through collaborations with the EuroMoonMars initiative. Finally, as part of the 5th cohort of the Homeward Bound initiative for women in science, she will also be taking part in a trip to Antarctica in 2021.

		Ms Priyanka Rajkakati is a PhD in aerospace engineering (by profession) and an artist (at heart). Her childhood ambition was to pursue three passions in one lifetime: Science, Art &amp; Space. 

Extremely passionate about Space, Priyanka wants to help build the first lunar and martian human bases (and go there!). She has analog-astronaut experience at HI-SEAS (EMMIHS-III lunar simulation as commander-in-training) and has been actively involved with the ILEWG EuroMoonMars Program as an artist for the Moon Gallery, which will take her artwork to the Moon in 2022. On the side, she is actively involved in STEM outreach: as ambassador for L’ORÉAL-UNESCO “For Girls in Science” program, as organiser of the SGAC “Our Giant Leap” initiative, and as part of the 5th cohort of the Homeward Bound Antarctica mission. She loves that through Science, she is able to travel the world and experience new cultures.

Priyanka has always lived a dual personality, with two vivid sides fused into one: as an expressive artist and also as a reserved, hyper-logical scientist. Add to that: an obsession with Space. Through years spent experimenting with various scientific fields, she realised that she kept repeatedly gravitating towards the artistic aspect of the subject at hand. Finally, the space domain, which is highly interdisciplinary, she found a way to mix art and science. An expert to the IAF Technical Committee on the Cultural Utilisation of Space (ITACCUS), her artwork currently focuses on experimentation with mixed-media techniques.

	<h2>Exploring the Art+Science Duality</h2> 
	Priyanka has always lived a dual personality, with two, seemingly contradictory, sides fused into one: as a dynamic and expressive artist, and also as a reserved, logic-oriented scientist. And then, a wide-eyed fascination for Space.

	<h2>Art+Science+Space</h2> 
	On discovering that the domain of Space research was in fact a highly interdisciplinary field, Priyanka found a context for her work in mixing Art and Science. Her work currently involves experimentation with mixed-media art techniques and visual representation of data. She has also illustrated for magazine covers, articles and contributed designs for communication-related activities.
