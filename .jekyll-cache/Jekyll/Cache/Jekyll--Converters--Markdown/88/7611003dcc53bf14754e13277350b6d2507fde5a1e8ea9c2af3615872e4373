<h3>Art in Science in Space</h3>
<p>
	Ever since I can remember I have been interested in three specific things: Space, Science and Art.
	<br /><br />
	Growing up, I often thought about how grand it would be to live a life that mixed these three into a single passion, and thus I set off on a quest on the ultimate pursuit of happiness. After extensive experimentation and several unconventional choices, I have started to see the end of the tunnel. I have nearly come "full-helix", having started an art and design degree, to leaving it to become a Physicist, to becoming an Aerospace Engineer and now finally, somehow, a Space Artist (and also analogue-astronaut).
	<br /><b></b>
	For me, art and science are not distinct. When you pursue both fields, you reach inevitably reach a “grey zone”, where the art you do requires a bit of science, and the science you do is fantastically artistic. It was not very surprising that, after years spent pursuing scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating to the artistic aspect of the subject at hand. Would you like some examples?
	<br /><br />
	In Biology, I was fascinated by bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns. This picture below is a bacterial culture that I had infused with Green-Fluorescent Protein (GFP) extracted from jellyfish. I was in fact so enthralled by the outcome, that I managed to "borrow" these samples to show to my friends; but the security guards who caught me on CCTV behaved as though I were stealing national treasure.
	<br /><br />

	In Computer Science, I saw an infinite potential for algorithmic art. Here is a fun fact: I made these simulations when I was first learning to code. I took a different approach than the rest of my classmates - motivated by art-lust - and started programming with a passion. A Physics professor thought I was a Computer WhizKid because my graphical interface was so convincingly elaborate.

	In Signal Processing, I was fascinated by the geometric patterns made by signals and noise, Fourier Transforms and Gaussian curves. I am actually pursuing a PhD at the moment in this domain, on satellite navigation. When the engineer I work with at University, showed me this GPS signal code he had written, I could not stop thinking of the art one could create out of it (and science too, obviously).

	And the list goes on...

	This is the grey zone that excites me, and where I have currently set up my workstation, drawing inspiration from the work of scientists, philosophers, and through collaborations with other artists.
