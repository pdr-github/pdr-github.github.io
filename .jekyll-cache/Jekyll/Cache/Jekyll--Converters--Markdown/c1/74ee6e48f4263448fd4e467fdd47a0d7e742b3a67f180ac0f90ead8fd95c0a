<h2>PriyanKaleidoscope</h2>
<p>
	My life resembles a three-sided Kaleidoscope. Each side represents the things I have been passionate about since I was a child: Science, Art ... and Space. Individually, each is just a regular fa√ßade depicting my interests, but combined they reflect a shining myriad of possibilities which complete me.

<h3>Space-girl</h3>
<p>
	A hitchhiker through the journey of life, I have always been in search of a route that would ultimately lead me into Space. Born in the Himalayan mountains, I grew up in Delhi, moved to France, and this year ‚Äì a lunar analogue-astronaut mission in Hawai‚Äôi and a voyage to <a href="\Antarctica">Antarctica</a>!

<h3>Art in Science in Space</h3>
<p>
	Growing up, I often wondered how to chart out a path that would successfully mix these three domains into a single passion. It took me a few unconventional choices, but finally I've started to see the end of the tunnel. It's as though I have come "full-helix" - having started an art and design degree, to leaving it to become a Physicist, to becoming an Aerospace Engineer, to NASA, ESA, and now finally, somehow, a Space Artist (and also analogue-astronaut).
	<br /><br />
	Over the years, I've become more and more convinced that Art and Science are not disjoint fields. When you pursue both these fields, you inevitably reach a ‚Äúgrey zone‚Äù, where the Art you do requires a bit of Science, and the Science you explore is fantastically artistic. It was not very surprising that, after years spent pursuing scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating towards the artistic aspect of the subject at hand.

<h4>Some examples</h4>
<p>
	<b>[Biology]</b> I was fascinated by bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns. This picture below is a bacterial culture that I had infused with Green-Fluorescent Protein (GFP) extracted from jellyfish. I was in fact so enthralled by the outcome, that I managed to "borrow" these samples to show to my friends; but the security guards who caught me on CCTV behaved as though I were stealing national treasure.

<p>
	<b>[Computer Science]</b> There is an infinite potential for algorithmic art. Here is a fun fact: I made these simulations when I was first learning to code. I took a different approach than the rest of my classmates - motivated by art-lust - and started programming with a passion. A physics professor thought I was a Computer WhizKid because my graphical interface was so convincingly elaborate.

<p>
	<b>[Signal Processing]</b> I was fascinated by the geometric patterns made by signals and noise, Fourier Transforms and Gaussian curves. I am actually pursuing a PhD at the moment in this domain, on satellite navigation. When the engineer I work with at University, showed me this GPS signal code he had written, I could not stop thinking of the art one could create out of it (and science too, obviously).

	This is the grey zone that excites me, and where I have currently set up my workstation, drawing inspiration from the work of scientists, philosophers, and through collaborations with other artists.
