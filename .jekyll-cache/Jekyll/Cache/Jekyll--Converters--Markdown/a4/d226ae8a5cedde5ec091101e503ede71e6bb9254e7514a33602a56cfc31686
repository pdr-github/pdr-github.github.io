      <h2>About the "Our Giant Leap" initiative</h2>
<p>
	Who doesn’t dream about Space? It is the next frontier of human exploration. However, the Space sector still has a long way to go in becoming inclusive for everyone, especially women. The question becomes not simply, how to inspire, but how to sustain these dreams?
	<br /><br />
	The “Our Giant Leap” (OGL) initiative was born with the aim to build a Space network that would collaborate to push boundaries and achieve this objective of making the aerospace environment diversity-friendly.
	<br /><br />
	Priyanka was one of the founding members of this initiative and was instrumental in its structuring, reach and shaping future goals.
<br /><br />
This initiative received the SGAC "Member of the month" award in <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/mom-october-2020">October 2020</a>.
</p>
<h2>SG[France]2020</h2>
<p>
	With the help of a very dedicated team, the OGL team kickstarted this initiative with the SGAC. The kickoff event was launched on 26th October, 2020, as <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/event/sgfrance-2020">SG[France] 2020</a> at ISAE-Supaéro, Toulouse (France). It was the only face-to-face event of the SGAC in 2020.

	Priyanka was one of the original founders of this initiative and took part in its organisation as part of the Programs team (responsible for the Mentorship Working Group) and Communication team. Through the latter, she designed the logo and poster for the initiative and presented it during the Space Generation Congress (SGC) 2019 and the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2019 in Washington DC. She also worked on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pErzslMIl68&amp;feature=emb_logo">video</a> for the event, as well as recording retd. CNES astronaut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5f_sSXBi7k">Claudie Haigneré's message</a> for the participants. Lastly, she intiated the "Call for Artwork" program with the help of the OGL Communication team, through which OGL received more than 30 original artwork from across the world on the theme "Women in Aerospace", showcased <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T011D7ADA94/C0136NLHYJH">here</a> in the official OGL Slack channel.
