	 [PROFESSION] TO PURSUE FEMALE LEADERSHIP IN STEMM TO THE END OF THE EARTH

	Homeward Bound

<p align="justify">
	Homeward Bound is a global 12-month leadership initiative for women with a background in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine), which aims to equip a 1000-strong collaboration of women with the skills to demonstrate a new model of leadership, to create better outcomes for our planet.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	Research repeatedly shows that while women demonstrate great integrity and a legacy mindset when it comes to leadership, decision-making and the creation of collaborative and effective teams, they are overwhelmingly under-represented in the traditionally male-dominated professions. This is especially true of women in STEMM fields. For example, in the United States, women currently make up nearly half (48 percent) of the workforce, but hold less than 18 percent of leadership roles at top tech companies.

	Founded in 2016, the program was literally a dream of Australian leadership expert Fabian Dattner, who believed the world needed a program to unlock the leadership potential of outstanding women in STEMM, to upskill and support them to lead, influence and contribute to decision-making about the future of our planet. This 12-month program includes online learning to increase leadership capacity, strategic capability, visibility and collaboration, and culminates in a meeting of all 80 participants in Ushuaia, Argentina before embarking on a life-changing voyage to one of the most ecologically sensitive and inspiring areas on Earth, Antarctica, at the end of 2020.

	‘The aim of Homeward Bound has always been to identify and foster outstanding leadership potential in STEMM,’ Fabian said. ‘It is no accident that we end up in Antarctica, as it is part of the vision. It is where we can see the impact of our crisis of leadership and inaction first-hand. It is sensitive and challenging, awe-inspiring and motivating, and I can think of no more fitting experience for a group of leaders.’

	Homeward Bound welcomes 80 participants into its fifth program, encompassing more than 25 nationalities and a hugely diverse representation of STEMM fields. Homeward Bound is now nearly halfway towards achieving its vision of creating a global collaboration of 1000 women leaders with STEMM backgrounds.

	I am extremely honoured to have been selected for the fifth edition of the initiative. I feel very strongly for encouraging young girls to pursue Science and dare to dream about Space. Now, more than just good intent, such initiatives require momentum and being part of Homeward Bound will definitely help me with my cause.
