	Since I was child, I always had three passions: Space, Science and Art. I always had this dream where, I would one day be able to mix the three. After experimenting with my interests, a few unconventional choices later – I went from being a Physicist to an Aerospace Engineer and now finally, an Artist.

	For me, Art and Science are not distinct. If you pursue both fields, you reach a “grey zone” where the art you do requires a bit of science, and the science you do is heavily artistic.

	I did initially fall victim to the definitions set by society and at the age of 18, I chose to pursue Physics, giving up my seat at a prestigious school of design. Years later, after experimenting with all kinds of scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating to the artistic aspect of the subject at hand. In Biology, I was enthralled by bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns. In Computer Science, I saw an infinite potential for algorithmic art, even those generated by AI. In Signal Processing, which is a big part of my PhD on satellite signals, I was fascinated by the patterns made by the original geometric signals and the noise that the signal accumulates - the beauty of Fourier Transforms and the Gaussian curves! One of the people whose work inspired me was Antonio Gaudi, and his nature-inspired works of architecture.

	This is the grey zone that excites me and where I have currently set up my worktable. Inspired by the work of a lot of physicists, artists and even philosophers, who have been exploring this grey zone, I have been very fortunate to find a lot of collaborations especially with the European Space Agency (ESA), from world renowned space scientists to artists who have sent their work to the international space station (ISS) showcased even by astronaut Thomas Pesquet.
