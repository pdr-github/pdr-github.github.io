  About the artist
</p>

<p>
	Since I was child, I always had three passions: Space, Science and Art. I always had this dream where, apart from being an astronaut, I would one day be able to mix the three. I think it sort of confused my parents as to what I wanted to become when I grew up ‚Äì but they did encourage me and tried to guide me in their own way. Since I lacked role models at that time (access to information was limited to the early 2000‚Äôs internet), I had to experiment a lot with my interests, and a few unconventional choices later ‚Äì I went from being an Indian Physicist to a French Space Engineer and now finally, a global Space Artist.

	For me, Art and Science are not distinct. If you pursue both fields, you reach a ‚Äúgrey zone‚Äù where the art you do requires a bit of science, and the science you do is heavily artistic. I did initially fall victim to the definitions set by society and at the age of 18, I chose to pursue Physics, giving up my seat at a prestigious school of design. Years later, after experimenting with all kinds of scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating to the artistic aspect of the subject at hand. In Biology, I was enthralled by bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns. In Computer Science, I saw an infinite potential for algorithmic art, even those generated by AI. In Signal Processing, which is a big part of my PhD on satellite signals, I was fascinated by the patterns made by the original geometric signals and the noise that the signal accumulates - the beauty of Fourier Transforms and the Gaussian curves! One of the people whose work inspired me was Antonio Gaudi, and his nature-inspired works of architecture.

	This is the grey zone that excites me and where I have currently set up my worktable. Inspired by the work of a lot of physicists, artists and even philosophers, who have been exploring this grey zone, I have been very fortunate to find a lot of collaborations especially with the European Space Agency (ESA), from world renowned space scientists to artists who have sent their work to the international space station (ISS) showcased even by astronaut Thomas Pesquet.
