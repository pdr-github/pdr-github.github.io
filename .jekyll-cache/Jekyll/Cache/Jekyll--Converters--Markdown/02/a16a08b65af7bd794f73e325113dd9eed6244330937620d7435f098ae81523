<h2><i>PriyanKaleidoscope</i></h2>
<p>
	I like to compare my life to a three-sided kaleidoscope, where each side represents one of the three things that I have been passionate about since I was a child: Science, Art and Space. Individually, each is just a regular façade depicting my interests, but combined they reflect a shining myriad of possibilities.
</p>
<h2>Space-girl</h2>
<p>
	A hitchhiker through the journey of life, I have always been in search of a route that would ultimately lead me into Space. Born in the Himalayan mountains, I grew up in Delhi, moved to France, and this year – a lunar analogue-astronaut mission in Hawai’i and a voyage to <a href="\Antarctica">Antarctica</a>!

<h2>Art in Science in Space</h2>
<p>
	Growing up, I often wondered how to chart out a path that would successfully mix these three domains into a single passion. It took me a few unconventional choices, but finally I've started to see the end of the tunnel. It's as though I have come "full-helix" - having started an art and design degree, to leaving it to become a Physicist, to becoming an Aerospace Engineer, to NASA, ESA, and now finally, somehow, a Space Artist (and also analogue-astronaut).
	<br /><br />
	Over the years, I've become more and more convinced that Art and Science are not disjoint fields. When you pursue both these fields, you inevitably reach a “grey zone”, where the Art you do requires a bit of Science, and the Science you explore is fantastically artistic. It was not very surprising that, after years spent pursuing scientific fields, I realised that I was always gravitating towards the artistic aspect of the subject at hand.

<h4>Some examples</h4>
<p>
	<b>[Biology]</b> This picture below is an <i>E. Coli</i> bacterial culture infused with Green-Fluorescent Protein (GFP) extracted from jellyfish. I could stare at bioluminescent bacteria and their patterns for hours.

<p>
	<b>[Computer Science]</b> There is an infinite potential for algorithmic art. I made these simulations when I was first learning to code. 12 years later, they're now being sent with the <a href="\Portfolio\MoonGallery">Moon Gallery</a> to the Moon!

</p>
<p>
	<b>[Signal Processing]</b> I was fascinated by the geometric patterns made by signals and noise, Fourier Transforms and Gaussian curves. I am currently pursuing a PhD in this domain, on satellite navigation.

	Et voilà !

<p class="message" align="center">
	This is the grey zone that excites me, and where I have currently set up my workstation, drawing inspiration from the work of scientists, philosophers, and through collaborations with other artists.
