	She has eyes,
	
	Which smile,
	Once in a while,
	To reconcile
	With hopes that beguile,
	And cruelly defile
	That elusive smile.

	Her tears form the Nile,
	Her wrinkles run a mile,
	Her heart, a lonely isle.

	But fighting the trial
	Of Hope's dark guile,
	She stops a while,
	And does still smile,
	Even if once a while,
	An elusive smile.
